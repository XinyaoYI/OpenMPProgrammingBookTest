In C code, the directives are formed exclusively with pragmas, whereas in C++ code, directives are formed from either pragmas or attributes.

Clause modifiers may be \"simple\" or \"complex\" -- a complex modifier consists of a  keyword followed by one or more parameters, bracketed by parentheses, while a simple  modifier does not. An example of a complex modifier is the __iterator__ modifier,  as in __map(iterator(i=0:n),tofrom: p[i])__, or the __step__ modifier, as in __linear(x:__ __ref,__ __step(4))__.
